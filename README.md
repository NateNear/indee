### accessibility features for disabled users

1. Added aria-label or aria-labelledby attributes to elements that require additional context or labeling.
2. Added alt text to images for screen readers.
3. Added aria-live attribute to elements that update dynamically.
4. Ensured proper focus management and keyboard accessibility by adding :tabindex attribute to the submit button.
5. Added role attributes to clarify the purpose of elements (e.g., role="img" for the background image).
6. Added aria-hidden="true" to decorative icons to prevent them from being read by screen readers.
